In microservices systems, the identification of root causes of anomalies is imperative for service reliability. The different layers in microservices introduce levels of granularity in the telemetry data, which can be challenging when troubleshooting such a system. This simple ---one page paper--- attempts to provide a better understanding of the multi-granular and telemetry-based approach to root cause analysis (RCA). It also links to practical examples on github \cite{Github}.
