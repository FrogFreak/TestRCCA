We are creating practical examples of multi-granular RCA on Github \cite{Github}. The short term goal is to provide (1) a simulation environment with K3D, (2) instrumentation at application, cluster and service-mesh level using the OpenTelemetry standard, (3) feature selection for root cause localisation.
